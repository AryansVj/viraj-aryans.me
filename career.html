            <p>Engaged in the Department of Automotive Electronics under the supervision of Eng. Nisal Bulathsinghala 
                (Head of the Department, Automotive Electronics). During the internship I was involved in a solo project 
                instructored by the senior engineers to design and develop a prototype for a power distribution module 
                that could be used when controlling various subsystems in an Electric Vehical. The specific module I was 
                assigned with had to be powered by MOSFETs for switching mechanism and should accomodate 8 channels of 
                power distribution summing upto a total of 100 A of current flow through the circuit at maximum capacity.</p>
