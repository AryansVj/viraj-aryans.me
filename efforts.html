        <h3>A Retrospect</h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Since my school days, I have harbored a deep passion for organizing and leading events and projects, fueled by an enduring enthusiasm for voluntary work. This passion has driven me to take on several significant roles during my time at the University of Peradeniya as well. As the Secretary of the IEEE Student Branch for the 2023-2024 term, I have played a crucial role in coordinating activities and fostering a collaborative environment for our members. My dedication to extending the IEEE's reach and opportunities beyond the Faculty of Engineering to the entire university community has been a significant milestone in this journey. One of my proudest achievements was founding the IEEE Computer Society at the University of Peradeniya as the founding chair. And I was also able to serve as the IEEEXtreme 17.0 Ambassador for University of Peradeniya, where we  could organize a coding arcade for the IEEEXtreme coding challenge for the first time in in-person mode in peradeniya.</p>
        <p>My involvement extended to the Rotaract Club of University of Peradeniya, where I served as Vice President for PR/ER while also holding the position of Sargent at Arms in the 2022-2023 term. There I was able to contribute to various award winning initiatives including some gold award recognitions at the 33rd Annual District Assembly for RID3220. I was also able to play a pioneering role in establishing Leoism at the University of Peradeniya as part of the charter executive committee of the Club. As a collective effort we could earn the title of the Most Outstanding New Leo Club of the Year in 2022 for the Leo club of University of Peradeniya which was established in December 2021</p>      
        <p>These experiences have been instrumental in shaping my personal growth, teaching me the value of perseverance, leadership, and teamwork. The enjoyment in all these work with various people together with the satisfaction of the effort to make a positive impact has instilled in me a sense of purpose. It has taught me to embrace new challenges and rooted in me a deep appreciation for the new experiences each day brings. I am grateful for these opportunities, people and the lessons they have imparted, preparing me to continue making a lasting imprint on the way forward. </p>
